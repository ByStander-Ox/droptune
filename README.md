## About

I ([@Shpigford](https://twitter.com/Shpigford)) started this project two years ago, let it fall by the wayside, and in that time all the music APIs have changed. So, started from scratch and making it open source from the get go.

## Current status
This is absurdly new. I've got it working locally for a single account. No idea about production or multiple users.

## Contributing
It's still very early days for this. It doesn't exist on any public servers yet...all dev work is still just local. So, your mileage will vary here and lots of things will break.

But almost any contribution will be beneficial at this point.

If you've got an improvement, just send in a pull request. If you've got feature ideas, simply [open a new issues](https://github.com/Shpigford/droptune/issues/new)!
